# Neural Learning 101
This time I'll definitely learn how to deal with Neural Networks

# Briefing
The purpose of this repository is to centralize all my efforts in the Neural Networks / Machine Learning / Deep Learning / AI areas. Also note that this repo isn't going to be a how-to or something.

I'll update it eventually with material that I'm studying and code examples. Imagine it as a playground.
